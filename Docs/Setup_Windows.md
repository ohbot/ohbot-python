Background
-----

These instructions allow you to program your Ohbot using Python on a Windows PC.

More information about Ohbot can be found on [ohbot.co.uk.](http://www.ohbot.co.uk)

Please contact [info@ohbot.co.uk.](info@ohbot.co.uk) if you have any problems installing or running Ohbot.

Setup
--------
Download a Python installer from [here.](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-364/) On Windows the Ohbot library currently only works with Python versions up to 3.6.

We chose version 3.6 Windows x86-64 executable installer.

Tick the option to Add Python 3.6 to PATH then click on Install Now.

Once install is complete type “Command” into the Windows search box.  Right click on <b>Command Prompt </b> and select <b>Run as administrator.</b>

This will open a command prompt window. 

Type the folloing:

``pip install ohbot``

To upgrade to the latest version of the library run the following in the console:
```pip install ohbot --upgrade```

Installing more voices (optional)
--------

The Ohbot Python library will default to using SAPI voices which are the voices that are available through Windows Control Panel:Speech Propeties.

You can change this to espeak or espeak-ng by calling ohbot.setSynthesiser (“espeak”) or ohbot.setSynthesizer (“espeak-ng”).

Install the espeak library from [here.](http://espeak.sourceforge.net/download.html)


Install espeak and then copy the espeak.exe file in Windows File Explorer from 

C:\Program Files (x86)\eSpeak\command_line

To 

C:\Program Files\Python36

To use the espeak-ng library install it from [here.](https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng#binaries)

Install espeak-ng and then copy the espeak-ng.exe and espeak-ng.dll files in Windows File Explorer from 

C:\Program Files\eSpeak NG

To 

C:\Program Files\Python36

That should be it for the setup.
